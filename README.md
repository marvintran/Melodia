# Melodia

## Vision Summary

Melodia is a music player which has a unique feature of sharing playlists.

## Description

By using the device's local storage, people will be able to manage their libraries of songs. With Melodia, music listeners will be able to play local content, browse their music libraries to find songs and create playlists to listen to. A special feature of Melodia will be the ability to create an account and add playlists to their profile to share with others. 

## Audience

Melodia is designed for use by anyone. The software is going to be targeted towards Android phones, with the ability to extend into other platforms such as iOS and desktop computers.

## Capabilities

The interface should be approachable and allow the person to easily look through their music library and organize their songs. This includes a search function and filter capabilities to sort their library by track name, artist, genre and more. 

During music playback, relevant information about a song will be displayed. This includes information such as the song name, artist, album and cover art. The currently playing queue will have all of the standard features of a music player, such as shuffling songs and skipping songs. 

Additionally, people should be able to view their listening habits. These statistics would include their most songs played, the genres listened to, total time listened and other similar fields.

## Value

Melodia is more than just a music player. By making an account, people can save playlists to their profile. These playlists can be publicly displayed, allowing a music fan to easily discover new artists, songs and genres. This allows playlists to be quickly and efficiently distributed to friends or family. 

## Success Criteria

Melodia will be considered a success based on three criteria.

* After someone uses Melodia for a minimum of 10 minutes, they will be asked to fill out a survey regarding their preferences compared to other music players they have used. If over 50% of people prefer Melodia over their preferred music player, this first criteria will be considered a success.
* The second piece of criteria will be the speed at which someone can create a playlist. If searching for a song in their library and creating a playlist can be done in under 10 steps, this second criteria will be considered a success.
* Lastly, the time it takes to create a playlist and add it to their account to share with others should be less than 2 minutes.
