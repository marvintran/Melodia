					<h2>Postmortem</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Developing Melodia provided great experience when it comes to developing large projects in the future. It showed us how to function as a team of developers to create something with a larger scope than we could have individually. </p>
					<p>There were quite a few positives that we can take away from the experience, as well as some things to keep in mind for the future. A few sections that we thought went particularly well during development were the architecture, the use of a fragment-based lifecycle. Some areas that could have been improved on were the share feature and the estimated times for development.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Architecture</h2>
					<br>
					<p>The architecture used was the three-tier architecture that we planned to use from iteration 0. This architecture was easy to access and helped us organize our code neatly. It also gave us some valuable insight on how important it is that an architecture is decided upon while developing. It is good to give each layer a clear responsibility and keep all relevant code in these sections making the program overall easier to navigate.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Fragments</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Our group chose to use fragments for most of our user interface, instead of creating different activities for each separate screen. The fragments allowed us to communicate between different screens more easily. We only used one activity for our application and then had a navigation bar show and hide different fragments within the activity. It is possible that we should have used more than just the one activity but using fragments allowed us to gain insight into the lifecycle of an android application.  In the future it will likely be more obvious for us to see how to implement the user interface.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Vision</h2>
					<br>
					<p>The main feature we would have liked to implement in iteration 0 was the ‘share’ feature. The share feature would have allowed users to share their music with others and get recommendations on what kind of music they might like. In retrospect, that was a little bit ambitious. We found that the basic functionalities of Melodia, like playing music and creating playlists, took precedence over the share feature. The share feature would also require all the basic groundwork first, so we wanted to ensure that the basic functions worked properly. We did implement the basics well and would have liked to implement the share feature if there was more time to develop the app. Even though our vision changed as we developed the app, we still think we were relatively successful.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Development Time</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Another part of the development cycle that our group struggled with at first but improved as we developed more was the estimation of work. We overestimated the amount of work we could complete in the whole project. As the iterations went on, we began to understand that learning the technology, implementing the feature and fixing bugs takes quite a bit of time. In the future, we will probably be able to more accurately estimate development time, especially if it uses technology that we are familiar with.</p>
					<br>
					<h2>Conclusions</h2>
					<br>
					<p>Overall, developing a large project in a team helped us learn many things. Firstly, planning is key. Ensuring that all the team members are on the same page is paramount to quickly developing the application. It also helps if there is a clear architecture for the program, so that everyone knows where different parts of the project belong. It is also important to give development time estimates and the project velocity so that we know how much a reasonable amount of work is. Secondly, utilizing all the team members strengths can help the group massively. It is not possible to be the best at every portion of a project, so choosing the right person for the job helps quite a bit. Lastly, we should expect the project to change and grow as we develop it. Portions of the projects were not viable but other new ideas also come up during development. Being able to adapt to the situation as it occurs assists in delivering a reasonable application.</p>
